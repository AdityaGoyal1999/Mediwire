            <p> The market growth of global electronic medical record market has been accelerated due to feasibility in data availability across the globe and growing need of 
                integrated healthcare system. According to Reuter Health, "less than one in three U.S. hospitals can find, send, and receive electronic medical records for patients 
                who receive care somewhere else". We are looking to promote efficient data entry, thorough and complete patient data, 
                and uniformity across institutions. Ultimately presenting an enormous capital investment for many hospitals and other institutions throughout the country.</p>
